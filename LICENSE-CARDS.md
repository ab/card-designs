# Copyright for card images

The source code and text content in this repository are released under the
Mozilla Public License found in `LICENSE`.

But this repository also contains images of credit card designs authored by
others. The MPL license declaration does not apply to these images.

Credit card designs are copyrighted by their issuers. They also commonly
include trademarked symbols, phrases, and logos.

We believe distributing these images for educational and research purposes
qualifies as fair use under U.S. copyright law.

This is not legal advice, and you may wish to consult a lawyer before
reproducing or altering these images.

Applying the four factor test:

## 1. Purpose and character of the use

These images are used for non-commercial purposes: for education, reference
material for research, and artistic criticism of credit card designs.

## 2. Nature of the copyrighted work

The copyrighted card backgrounds are already published and widely distributed.

## 3. Amount and substantiality

While we do show the card backgrounds in their entirety, this is necessary to
the purpose of artistic criticism of the works.

## 4. Effect on the Market

Use of these card images for reference material does not decrease demand for
the original credit cards.

To the contrary, republishing the card backgrounds likely increases demand for
the original credit cards by encouraging public interest in the cards with the
most interesting or attractive designs.

The card images are used here in the context of discussing the original product
offerings. Similar imagery features prominently in advertisements created by
the issuers that are intended to promote their use.
